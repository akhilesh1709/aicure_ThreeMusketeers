# AI Cure - Team Three Musketeers

This repository contains the code which contains the model designed for the competition AI Cure: Where AI meets health. In this code, we have used a model called Stacking Regressor model that is used to obtain the heart rate of an individual given the features.

### Problem statement

Heart rate is a vital physiological parameter reflecting the frequency of cardiac contractions. Influenced by factors like age, fitness, and autonomic nervous system activity, heart rate serves as a key indicator of cardiovascular health. Monitoring heart rate during activities aids in optimizing exercise intensity and assessing overall well-being.The goal is to construct an advanced model capable of accurately predicting an individual's heart rate.

### File Descriptions

The dataset is provided in train_data.csv.

### Implementation Details
- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle any missing values, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables as needed.
- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is split into a training set and a test set.
- **Model Training:** The Stacking Regressor model is defined along with RidgeCV estimator and is used to train the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test data to assess its performance in prediction.

### Requirements
  - Python 3.x   

### Libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn (sklearn)
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
